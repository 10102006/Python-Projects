## Code functionality

1. **Handler**: This file is taking care of kinda the backend of the project, so like the database handling and shit.

   - Database: is the main class containing all the functions, this will take care of directory changing.
   - CreateSlot(name, startingTime, endingTime): is used for creating a slot dict obj for data storage.
   - SaveSlot(slotObject): uses the json module to save the slot obj made in a json file format.
   - LoadSlot(filename): uses the json module to extract the data saved in a specific file of name ```filename```.
   - SetIndex(slotObject): checks where the slot would fit in the schedule and then finds an appropriate index.
   - AdjustSlot(slotObject): is helpful in rearraging the slots according to there time-stamp.

``` python
    database = Database(database_path)

    # Single unique slot
    slot = database.CreateSlot("Jogging", (12, 32))

    # Saving the unique slot
    database.SaveSlot(slot)

    # Retrieving the Saved slot
    slot = database.LoadSlot(slot["Index"])

    # Placeholder slots
    for index in range(5):
        slot = database.CreateSlot(f"Task-{index}", (10 + index * 2, 0))
        database.SaveSlot(slot)

    # Rearranging the slots to accomodate the new slot
    database.AdjustSlot(slot)
```


***
1. **Viewer**: This file is like a front-end of the project as it is taking care of the viewer of the stuff.
    - Schedule(path, slots): is the main class containing all the function for viewing our schedule. ```slots``` will contain all the slots we have saved, this class will turn it into a ```schedule``` object
    - MakeSchedule(): will add the items to there respective key in ```schedule``` object.
    - PrintSchedule(schedule): will print all the schedule in the above metioned format.

``` python
    scheduleManager = Schedule(database_path, Slots)

    #  Making a schedule
    schedule = scheduleManager.MakeSchedule()

    # Printing the Schedule
    scheduleManager.PrintSchedule(schedule)
```

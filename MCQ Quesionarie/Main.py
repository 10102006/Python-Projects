Database = {
  question id: {
    question: 'Pick one?',
    answer: b,
    options:[a, b, c, d]
  }
}

Things Done:
    1. MakeQuestion(question, options, answer) =>
        This function will make a dict with the attributes as the params and then it will return the dict => question-object.

    2. SaveQuestion(d_question, fn_question, folder, makefolder) =>
        This will make a file using the question-object from the above function, this can also make a seperate folder with the file inside it. This will make the file data in a raw format using the dict values.

    3. RetrieveQuestion(fn_question, folder) => 
        This function will retrieve the raw data from the file made by the above function.
        Then this will make the raw data into a dict which can be stored since that will be returned and added to the database dict

    4. DisplayQuestion(_question) => 
        This function will display the question in the console. But this function need the the question format to display the question

    # Summary

Things done:
      1. MakeRandomText(numberofletters, firstletter, lastletter, caps):
            1. numberofletter is self explanatory
            2. the letter will be assigned from the first and last letter var
            3. caps will randomly make some text capitalize
            4. This will also sometimes make the space inside the string
      2. UserInput(rf_string):
            1. Take input from the user
            2. Check how good the user had done and store the marks in a hash table
            3. Returning the hash table for score generation
      3. CalculateScore(hs_score, time):
            1. hs_score will be the hash_table returned from the above method
            2. First we will append the score of the hash table in a list
            3. Then we will do some calculation for the score generation calculation in detail is done bellow
            4. then we will return the score
      4. LogRunTime(str_time, end_time) =>
            1. str_time and end_time are the timing which I had sperately stored in the __main__, I will pass this to the function for it make a log
            2. We first making the main log file which will contain a string as the base then there will the current month name
            3. I will be making the file appending at the last this will contain nothing much

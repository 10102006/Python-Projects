    # Summary

Tasks:
      *1. MakeRandomFiles(numberOfFile) => This method will make random file with random capitalisation of first letter
      *2. GetFiles(folderpath) => This function will get all the files get there format and store them in different lists
      *3. RenamingOffiles() =>
           1. CapitaliseFiles(filecapitalised) => This method will get the files and then capitalise them
           2. NumberFormat() => This Method will numberise the files of a specific format
           3. LeaveFile(fileNumbered) => This function will remove the file from the list whose file of the files
       4. Format() => This function will unite the methods to do the job

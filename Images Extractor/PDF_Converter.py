  Overview

What has beeen done:
    1. Importing all the necessary modules
    2. We need two path for:
        1. First path should be of a folder were the images are stored
        2. Second where we will store the pdfs
        ** These path are for checking and debugging of code
    3. ** There are two class Main/Solo
        1. Main class will only do the job required
        2. Solo is like a documented pdf making where we will print each file names which are made pdf
    4. Main:
        1. Initialising the pdf_folder_path and image_folder_path in the class
        2. MakePdf:
            ** This function will make pdf of an image whose name is given, and is in the images folder
        3. MakePdfs:
            ** This function will make all the images in the images folder into a seperate files in the a folder specified
        4. Pdfs_Merger:
            ** This function will merge all the pdfs in a specified folder
    5. Solo:
        1. This class does the same thing as above just one difference that we ae printing all the reseults in the console as output like:
            1. What files are made into pdf
            2. What files are merged
            3. If the merged files making is success or not
